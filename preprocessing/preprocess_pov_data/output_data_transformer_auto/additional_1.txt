The story of teeth -lrb- 6 -rrb- . I  have  kept the good habit of having my  teeth cleaned ever since I  knew it could claim my  life if I  abruptly go  to clean my  teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned . After my  still upright but “ left – tilting “ teeth crouched in my  mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after I  graduated and found a job . The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me  decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.The incident was caused by a molar . The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my  first visit to an American dentist . For some unknown reason , when i  was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful . Unexpected i  heard a " crack " while i  was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !. I  could not remember eating anything hard ?!. I  rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !. I  did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy . It was after i  began to receive it that i  found it really painful !. For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ... I e asked the dentist then why my  tooth broke . After examining my  25 teeth , the dentist told me  seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my  teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other . The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth . I  asked what solutions are available ? The dentist said " correction . " Thus , three years after i  ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " i  stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ... – Hard work without talent is a shame , but talent without hardwork is a tragedy ! -lrb- are you a shame or a tragedy ?? or maybe a " shamgerdy ? " -rrb- .

<raw_sequence>: dealing with the dental crown ... i e asked the dentist then why my tooth broke . after examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other . the wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth . i asked what solutions are available ? the dentist said " correction . " thus , three years after i ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " i stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ... – hard work without talent is a shame , but talent without hardwork is a tragedy ! -lrb- are you a shame or a tragedy ? ? or maybe a " shamgerdy ?
