<document_text>
I  would remember that moment when I  interviewed a woman named Eve Johnson for my  first story involving Child Protective Services. Because she  had already written several letters to the paper, I  knew some of her story already. I  knew that Child Protective Services had taken her  grandchildren away from her daughter-in-law because her daughter-in-law's new boyfriend had been abusing them. I  knew that the children were two and five years old. And I  knew that the children had been placed in foster care, despite the fact that Ms. Johnson wanted to care for them.What I  would learn, when she  came to my  office, was that Ms. Johnson had a certificate in early-childhood education. She had served as a teacher's aide for seven years. She had also, by the time I  spoke with her, completed a series of workshops for prospective foster parents. After learning the requirements for certification as a foster parent, Ms. Johnson told me , she had been surprised that she did not already have the children. “ I'm active, I cook, I have time to give, I babysit for friends, ” she told me . “ There's no reason why I shouldn't be caring for those kids. ”When she first requested that her grandchildren be placed with her, two weeks after they were taken from their mother, Ms. Johnson was required to have a fingerprint scan and a background check. The fingerprint scan revealed that Ms. Johnson had been convicted of the felony “ discharging a firearm with gross negligence ” in 1989. From that point forward, this would be the fact around which her entire case revolved. It would also be the fact that interested me  least. At some point I  reluctantly asked Ms. Johnson why she discharged that firearm, but the extent to which I  felt that it was none of my  business is reflected by the omission of her  answer in my  notes. I  made only the vague notation “ Domestic violence, ” which I  do  not now know how to interpret.To me , the gun was not the story. This was in part because the crime had already been punished. Ms. Johnson had served her probation without incident, and her sentence did not include any restrictions on raising her grandchildren. But, more important, I  was beginning to understand that the gun in Ms. Johnson's story was functioning, again and again, as an excuse for the inexcusable. And after working my  way through the file of letters that had been sent to the Voice by parents whose children had been taken away by Child Protective Services, and after doing some more interviews, I  was beginning to understand that there was always a gun, there was always a crime that was being punished, no matter how far outside the law the punishment was ranging.In the case of Tonya, a young mother who asked me  not to print her last name, the gun was a fistfight with her sister. Tonya's mother had called the police to break up this fight, and the police officer who responded had called in a social worker because Tonya had two small children. The social worker took Tonya's two-week-old infant and her toddler because she mistook the birthmarks on the infant's back and bottom for bruises. “ It was like an abduction, ” Tonya told me . A child-abuse expert later identified the bruises on Tonya's baby as permanent birthmarks, but the baby and his brother were not returned. After seven months of taking mandated classes and appearing in court and dealing with first one social worker and then another, Tonya still did not have her children. I  was not unfamiliar with child-protection agencies, or their services, when I  began working for the Voice. My  stepsister had a baby a few years after I  left home for college, and when her baby was around a year old, she got drunk and passed out long enough for the baby to start wailing and for her landlord to call the police, who arrested her for endangering a child. The New York State Office of Children and Family Services took the baby, and for some time my  mother and Barry cared for her. This would have been all right if Barry hadn't been in the process of losing his mind, a process that had started very quietly but was just then reaching a crescendo. He was, during that time, screaming at my  mother and then pulling the phone out of the wall when she tried to use it. I  had left some potted plants with my  mother when I  moved out, and when I  came back for them the pots were smashed. Back then, when the baby was passed on to another relative, I  was relieved.*Shortly after her fingerprints were taken, Ms. Johnson was told by a social worker that because her felony was more than ten years old, it would not affect her ability to take custody of her grandchildren. Inspectors came to her apartment, and she was told that it would be suitable for the children on a temporary basis but that she would eventually have to move.So Ms. Johnson was preparing for her grandchildren to move in with her, buying clothes and shoes and bed linens for them, when she was informed by a second social worker that not ten but twelve years must have passed after her conviction before she could have the children. It had been, at that time, about eleven and a half years since her conviction. When she wrote CPS to find out whether the time period was ten years or twelve, she received a letter from a third social worker informing her that it was twenty years. I  sifted through all these letters, called social workers who would not talk to me  or would not call me  back, made time lines, and read Ms. Johnson's foster-care manual. A tradition of caring for children within kinship networks, the manual informed me , is an integral part of African American culture. After being redirected many times, eventually to the licensing department at CPS, I  learned that generally an individual is eligible to serve as a foster parent if ten years have passed after a felony conviction. But, I  was told, these decisions are made on a “ case-by-case basis. ”
