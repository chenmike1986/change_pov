One of the most frustrating things about being narcissistically abused is that you  are  often told how bad, insensitive, selfish, uncaring and incompetent you  are . It doesn't matter how hard you  try  to do the right thing, Mike  still finds  fault with you .If the narcissist in your life  is  a love partner - the relationship didn't start that way.In stark contrast you  thought you  could do no wrong with this person  - in fact you  could not imagine them  ever getting annoyed about anything.Generally … that's how narcissistic relationships kick off - as glorious and delightful.If the person inflicting narcissistic abuse in your life  is  a family member, maybe you  can not remember anything but being demeaned and criticised … yet there may have been extremely confusing times when this family member  knew how to turn on the charm to play you  and get something from you .And at these times you  hoped that the abuse would stop and that this person  really did love you  and care about your  wellbeing.However the cycles of abuse and demeaning inevitably repeated all over again.Why does this happen?Why is  Mike  sometimes so wonderful, and then again rarely appeased for long, and incessantly finding fault with you ?That's what I am going to explain in this article.Mike's  Reasons For Initially Idolising You  Before the Demeaning StartsThe interesting thing about narcissistic abuse, in regard to the initial charm known as love bombing and the constant criticism (known as devalue and discard), in both cases Mike  is  a chameleon.It really doesn't have too much to do with his  preferences - it actually has to do with what will hook you  in the beginning the most, and what will hurt you  as time progresses the most.It's all about getting a reaction and energy.This is why it is pointless to try to work out why Mike  wants  this or wants  that and how you  can change whatever you  are  or are  not doing to try to make Mike  happy.Because it actually has nothing to do with what you  are  or are  not doing that is “ fabulous ” at the start, or “ terrible ” as time progresses - all of that is an excuse.At the beginning of the relationship - or when love bombing you  and pulling you  back into the fold - Mike  has  discovered what your  “ gaps ” are.The things you  desperately want  to hear to feel good and the things that “ turn you  on ”.This is what made you  initially trust Mike , fall in love with him , and get excited about spending your  life with this person . In regards to a family member narcissist or being love bombed by an intimate partner narcissist after trying to break up with them - these are the exhibitions of “ affection ” that make you  want to reconnect.Narcissists are experts at manipulation. Mike  very quickly is  able to identify what you  like , what your  dreams are, and also what you  missed out on that you  would have dearly loved … what your  childhood and other partners did not necessarily provide you .These are the gaps that Mike  fills  in, and tragically set up so many people to be narcissistically abused.And Mike  will go out of his  way to go beyond the call of duty to do the little and big stand out things that differentiate him  from anyone else you  have  been out with.Narcissists, initially and when love bombing, are generally very demonstrative and incredibly charming. At these times Mike  knows  how to position himself  as the “ dream partner ” especially tailored for you .These are not attributes Mike  has ; this is all about how Mike  knows  how to play you . Mike  does  not feel real, and does  not even know who he  is  without narcissistic supply. But he  certainly knows  what it feels like to not be a real entity in his  own body … the terrible gnawing of screaming emptiness, self loathing and dire insecurity - the feelings of always being close to total emotional collapse without energy from the outside feeding his  ego (False Self).There is no True Self available to have preferences or to have a real identity - there is simply the dire need to get attention, acclaim, stuff, compliments, even other people's negative emotions (this makes Mike  know he  is  important enough to affect a person) so that Mike  can escape being alone with himself  as often as possible.This is all about escaping an inner demonic void which is ever present, that threatens to eat Mike  alive.Therefore the vital goal is: being whoever is necessary to secure you  as a source of narcissistic supply.The best way to do that is appear, as much as possible, to be everything that you  want  Mike  to be.Mike  works  out what you  like , what you  are  drawn to … topics such as spirituality, intelligence, religion,  sexual attention, compliments, tenderness, big future plans, being cooked for, or even if you  are  prone to fixing people who have been victimised - Mike  will incite your  need for fixing.Naturally the connection feels wonderful, you  are  having enough of your  gaps filled to feel euphoric.You  may feel a sense of “ wholeness ” with this person , or even a sense of “ coming home ”. Many people report that for the first time they felt TRULY loved and safe.This is the beginning - the dream days when you  thought this  was  the perfect person and it would always feel this wonderful.Mike  seemed so accommodating, understanding and gentle - and you  thought that you were both on the same side of the team.But it didn't last. Acts Don't LastSo why doesn't this “ wonderful ” stage last - even if it is an act?Because what is real can not stand the test of time. The truth always comes out - and the truth is Dr Jekyll is an act.Mike's  real self - the real inner being is Mr/Ms Hyde - a tormented self that is far from healthy, loving or capable of love.And even at the beginning there are cracks - especially if you  still retain  your  own interests, your  own time and your  own circle of friends (including members of the same sex as Mike ) …I promise you these are the people who flush narcissists out. These are the people who inherently know it is not healthy to do instant relationships, time is needed, and it is sensible to get to know someone before putting your heart, body and life on the line.They also know that healthy mature adults spend time apart, and things like neediness, possessiveness and jealousy do not constitute healthy relationship material.The love bombing stage is much easier for Mike  to pull off and hook you  with, if you  enmesh , if you  fall  in, and if you  allow  the fast bonding to occur.Once you  are  hooked, devoted and besotted Mike  can start relaxing. The snaring, enmeshing and taking narcissistic supply has been established.It has taken an almighty effort for Mike  to maintain “ decency ” and “ delightfulness ” in order to capture you , and when the need for Mike's  wonderful persona starts easing back … the cracks will start cracking open.This is when the damned if you are, and damned if you aren't stuff starts happening.How quickly that will happen depends on a few things.Many people say this happened hugely when they moved in with the narcissist, or married the narcissist, or that it was subtlety there all along and it just got worse and worse.The truth is: even at the beginning because Mike  is  a pathological self, he  will expose some personality flaws - and maybe very big ones - accidentally.It may be a look that you  see  when Mike  is  unaware that is really creepy or malicious. It may be something that Mike  says  that is “ off ”, something that is really “ wrong ”, a statement that is childish, demanding, nasty or warped.And when it happens something inside of you  twists into a knot …Something from Mike's  past may pop up … unsavoury stuff or drama that is not “ normal ”.One of the greatest warning signs is: there are things that you  sense  Mike  is  lying about - things that just don't add up. And for some reason you  do  not wish to confront them. Maybe you  even find  out about the lies, but you  do  not want to acknowledge them.If we are honest with ourselves, we know this is because we didn't want to shatter the illusion of how wonderful we wanted this person to be. Or, if you  do  confront these issues, somehow the reasons given to you  still don't make concrete sense and don't put you  at ease.Another warning sign is: Mike  is  isolating you  - and it is very difficult to have communications and relationships with other people without getting a weird vibe or disdain from Mike . Yet, you  may dismiss all of this subtly or obviously happening because the time you spend together is still wonderful.Mind you, NOT all narcissists will display all of this, but some or all of these warning signs will be apparent, and your  gut will register and feel ill at ease at these times.Some people have reported … people with very low self-esteem, that the narcissist right from the beginning treated them terribly, told them they would never be good enough from the narcissist, and abused them from the beginning.Most people need more of a show to get hooked in - some people don't - and Mike  quickly works  out which category people are in.One thing is for certain … that when you  are  sufficiently hooked Mike  will start to ascertain how far the mask can come off and still have you  around for narcissistic supply.That is if you  still have  something to offer that Mike's  ego wants, otherwise you  will be discarded. Attacking What Mike  Originally SupportedLet's further investigate how your  gap get used against you .Let's say you  have  body image issues. Originally Mike  professed to help you  feel good about your  body and love you  unconditionally. Mike  may have even asserted that he  loved fuller bodied partners.Now that you  are  hooked, Mike  is  mercilessly targeting your  body image with insults.Let's say you  hate  jealousy, and have  told Mike  about your  journey with jealous partners in the past. The narcissist  originally stated how much he  was  not the jealous type, and agreed with your  non jealous orientation 100%.Yet, now that the mask has slipped, Mike  starts  generating jealousy. Being suspicious, starting to make you  suspicious - and accusing you  of being untrustworthy as well as unjustly jealous.Another one of the most painful things about the demeaning that goes with narcissistic abuse is - you  can not win.What gets incredibly frustrating about narcissistic abuse is whatever you  do , you  are  “ wrong ”.Maybe Mike  has  told you  that you  are  lazy and you  do  not contribute enough - so you  pick  up overtime and start  working back late. But to your  dismay Mike  now accuses  you  of being a workaholic who only cares about money and certainly not about him  or your children.Because Mike  is  attacking your  body image, you  start  watching what you  eat  and exercise  more. Rather than Mike  being happy with you  losing weight, you  are  then accused of being obsessed with how you  look . I remember one of my most maddening “ damned if you do, damned if you don't ” situations was when we were renovating our house together. If I went to the hardware store with him for materials without wearing makeup he would tell me that I didn't care enough about being his partner to want to make myself look good for him (like I apparently did for everyone else). Then when I did wear makeup he would accuse me of doing this to get the attention of every other man in the hardware store.It was total madness!The Narcissistic Relief of Offloading Mike  can get additional pain relief from you  as a result of attacking your  weak spots.Narcissistic supply was the first part of this. Lovebombing you  and securing you , and then removing your  outer sources so that bit by bit by bit Mike  becomes  the centre of your  Universe, for good or for bad.Then Mike  can extract energy from you  at any time when Mike  needs  narcissistic supply, and when other sources of supply have dried up.If you  have  physically disconnected from Mike , and are  still obsessing emotionally about Mike , this still provides Mike  with psychic energy … I promise you - and this is a very vital part of what needs to be healed within ourselves - in order to heal from narcissistic abuse.However, when you  are  still in Mike's  physical space, there is the added benefit of being able to belittle you , so that when Mike's  inner demons can't get drowned out, Mike  can project them on to you .In effect what this is literally, is the assigning of these onto another person so that Mike  can try to attack and defeat his  internal enemies.Naturally this is unconscious - and according to Mike's  pathological and severely distorted brain wiring - these demons ARE you .In regard to consciousness, narcissists are on a very low end of the scale.Conscious people know how to have control over their emotions despite the circumstances.Unconscious people's emotions are controlled by the circumstances.Narcissists make up the circumstances to match their emotions.Narcissists make up events in their minds to match the inner painful feelings they experience, and have grave difficulty in separating fact from fiction.Therefore according to Mike's  twisted brain wiring, there is concrete evidence supporting his  accusations against you .These accusations come about in 3 different ways.1) Your  gaps that Mike  has  identified as your  weak points.2) What Mike  is  projecting in regard to his  own dark, shameful, unwholesome behaviour, and3) Anything that you  experience  connection, joy, acclaim, or fulfilment about that takes energy away from Mike . How Narcissistic Abuse EscalatesThe danger period begins when you  have  rationalised initial warning signs away, not confronted “ things that don't add up ” squarely and directly, and when you  have  talked yourself  into “ why ” you  should be in the relationship regardless.Now more cracks have appeared … things like jealousy, unease, put downs, inappropriate anger and behaviour, and Mike  taking umbrage at any perceived criticism.Now you  have  seen with your  own eyes that Mike  has  serious issues and is  not taking personal responsibility. There is always an excuse or someone else to blame.You  have  crossed the line of selling out your  gut feelings, and even putting up with real life unpleasant experiences with this person , as a trade off for something that Mike  is  providing you  with … something that you  are  not anchored healthily into for yourself .Maybe you  do  not speak lovingly to yourself .Maybe you  hold  harsh expectations that you  judge  yourself  by.Maybe you  criticize  rather than compliment  yourself .Maybe you  do  not know how to be with yourself  healthily in your  heart, and you  are  incessantly in your  mind disconnected from yourself .Maybe because these states were always how you  have  been as your  “ normal ”, you  had no idea that was even happening within yourself  until now.Mike  filled some or many of these gaps initially for you . Mike's  act took away the pain of self doubt and an insecure future, the fear of being alone and the pain of feeling unlovable, unworthy or not good enough.These remedies are what you  are  hanging on to, even though the initial large doses starting petering out to crumbs, and got replaced with abuse.When people work through their inner recoveries they discover how true this is, and the true reasons as to why you  have  been suffering the abuse and why you  stay  despite it.This following statement is one that I really want to include in as many of my radio shows and blog articles as possible - because it is so important to understand.We need to have this statement as our mantra.We will never tolerate a level of love less than the level of love we have for ourselves. So until we acknowledge this, and we do the essential work on ourselves, we get stuck in the grand illusions; the falsities that do not set us free from the agony of narcissistic abuse. We believe that this is all about what Mike  is  or is  not doing, and we cling trying to force Mike  to wake up and change in order to fix the trauma and the pain that we are experiencing.Not only is this akin to expecting a crocodile to roll over while we scratch its tummy, it's also completely missing the bigger picture point.Mike  was  never in your  life to love you , Mike  came into your  life as a messenger, helping you  locate and heal the parts of yourself  that weren't loving and approving of yourself .Do you believe that “ everything happens for a reason? ”Narcissist abuse is no exception - I promise you … The gaps that Mike  has  identified as your  weak points Most narcissists are really skilled at identifying your  weak points, and tailor the nasty behavior to suit the person in question. Our gaps include having unhealthy tolerances to certain things, and it is through identifying these gaps Mike  works  out what he  can get away with. If you  have  zero tolerance to affairs and would never put up with being cheated on, then Mike  will not throw other people in your  face, and will use another angle to demean you  with.If you  have  a tendency to hang on to adulterous partners rather than leave, and this has been your  pattern, Mike  will punish you  this way by battering you  with comments about Mike's  attraction to other people, and how you  are  not “ good enough ”. Mike  may even blatantly and indiscriminately have open affairs, knowing this will trigger your  emotional panic and hook you  in harder. To ascertain what your  weak links are and how they can be played, Mike  tries  out your  levels of tolerance.To understand your  own weak links you  can investigate the patterns you  have  had in relationships. What has hurt you  the most that you  still have  emotional energy tied up in? In short, what is it that you  still fear ?I promise you this: all of these unattended to traumas attract exactly what you  fear .Fear is as strong as an attraction force to a narcissist as blood is to a shark.Pain bodies hone in on, and attach, to pain bodies … point blank … period.Your  greatest fears may include being replaced by someone else, being abandoned, not being trusted and believed in, maybe having things stolen from you . Maybe they are: being physically, emotionally sexually or financially abused.This you  also need  to understand … what we fear we tend to draw into our lives and roll around with.In stark contrast, it is the things that we have healed and resolved that we no longer tolerate and play out.Please also understand this: tolerance doesn't just mean shutting your  mouth and putting up with it. Being tolerant means staying in the relationship in any capacity.If you  stay  attached to Mike  whilst being abused with your  weak spots - arguing, trying to catch Mike  out, trying to force Mike  to be accountable or change … be VERY clear … you  are  tolerating what is happening to you . You  are  also handing over A Grade narcissistic supply to Mike , which makes him  feel incredibly significant regarding being able to have such a powerful effect over another person.Zero tolerance means you  get  up and leave  regardless of the pain and the cost.Zero tolerance means that you  will not have “ that ” in your  life in any shape or form.Zero tolerance means you  will not sell yourself  out by compromising on what you  have  decided will never have any place in your  life.The things that you  have  zero tolerance about are the things that you  will never experience. Life does not need to hand you  these situations in order to heal your  self-esteem and help you  grow beyond your  previous self.You  do  not hate these things that you  have  zero tolerance for, and you  do  not fear them.They are just not any part of your  reality.This is the level to where your  previous and current emotional traumas, including unfinished childhood business, need to be healed to - in order to not get hooked by these weak spots.That is what the inner work is all about.As with all narcissistic abuse the ex-narcissist targeted my weak spots, my unfinished business, profoundly.But rather than accept how his many abusive behaviours were diminishing me piece by piece … I stayed, I argued, I prescribed, I lectured … I fought back.And I stayed even though there was no change or resolution that ever lasted.My reactions got worse and worse … and I didn't realise that this was wonderful for a narcissist - it granted him tons of attention. The knowing that he existed and had the power to affect another human being so significantly.All of this drama was keeping him distracted from his own tormented inner being and alive.The more I was hooked onto trying to get him to change his behaviour, the more I lost the ability to detach and look after myself, and as a codependent I had never mastered this skill previous to him anyway.In this severely dangerous state of me being separated from being anchored in my own body able to create my own sanity, safety and peace, he was able to swiftly pull out the rug from beneath me, with violent threats and actions, intimidation and or abandonment - with me not letting go.And I clung on to him trying to get him to fix what he was doing, because I felt like I would die if I could not.Because I wasn't detaching I was nowhere near taking responsibility for healing my own weak points that he was able to batter and hook me with.I know I am not the only one who has experienced this - the grave handing over of our power - not by a long shot.There is an entire community of people here who have played this out! What Mike  unconsciously detests  about his  own dark, shameful, unwholesome behavior.One of the most painful and exasperating parts of narcissistic abuse is being constantly accused of all the things that you  know  the narcissist is and does.Things like being materialistic, selfish, nasty, unfaithful, uncaring, devious, a bad parent … the list goes on and on.Everyone I know who has been narcissistically abused stated that so many of the things that the narcissist accused them of doing were all the things that the narcissist was doing him or herself.It's safe to say that a great deal of the blame throwing that Mike  does  will leave you  in shock, tearing your  hair out screaming, “ Look in the mirror! ”Anything you  receive  enjoyment, acclaim, purpose or fulfillment from.Anything that takes energy away from Mike  is going to be a target. So with this comes the accompanying nastiness, which is the response to Mike's  inner self loathing that is accentuated and further triggered by pathological envy towards you .This is in relation to people or activities that you  get  positive energy from, such as love, acknowledgement, accomplishment or joy.Because of the intense feelings of being inferior (unable to feel genuine happiness) and you  being superior (able to feel genuine happiness) Mike  needs  to take you  down a peg or twenty in order to feel vindicated.At these times it feels devastating that what is so important to you  is attacked and sabotaged by Mike  mercilessly.Many abuse forums like to purport that point number 3 makes us completely powerless and targeted, and it is all to do with how much we have to offer that the narcissist wants but can never have.But … we need to understand this focus only keeps us entrenched in ongoing powerlessness and victimisation.Yes, there are things that we are naturally happy about, accomplished at and get wonderful energy from that the narcissist pathologically abhors … but if we stay attached to the narcissist, regardless of the abuse, there are deep reasons within us as to why we aren't pulling away and honouring ourselves - and these are the gaps within us which require inner healing.So … if you  are  sufficiently hooked it is likely that you  will try to please Mike .Maybe you  start  feeling the insecurity of possibly losing Mike  - your  supply of security / love / approval / lifestyle / enjoyment / saviour from loneliness, and you  try  to adapt accordingly … you  try  to change to make this person  happy so that he  will stay connected to you .Maybe you  are  trying to keep the peace because you  do  not like confrontation - so you  give  in.Maybe you  doubt  yourself  and make  excuses for this person , or think  there is some value in what they  are saying – even though your  gut is trying to tell you  otherwise.Maybe you  do  try and stand up for yourself , but then give  in because Mike  knows  how to always up the ante in ways that make you  stay. The Narcissist Does Not Want ResolutionSo why doesn't the narcissist want resolution and peace? This is often the “ million dollar question ” that people ask.Before I understood enough about what was really going on and what I deeply needed to heal within myself, I used to view the situation through surface level human eyes.I know you  might be doing this too.Because I thought he ultimately wanted what every human wants - resolution and love.After leaving there were times when I believed this illusion more. This would follow on from clawing my way out of my horrendous addiction to him to get to a safe house away from his threats and abuse.Then he would switch the tables and love-bomb.Then I was back in the relief of believing that my prince charming did want love, happiness and happily-ever-after. And the evidence of this falling flat time and time again did not alter my delusions of relief and wanting to believe in him for years.Of course I believed in him, I had projected onto him the version of who I wanted him to be, rather than seeing him for the truth of who he was.Narcissists do not want happily ever after. They are not partnered with you  or anyone else. They serve one master only - the relentless ego that can never be filled or satisfied.Peace, normality, togetherness, love, gentleness, trust, honesty and teamwork are “ poison ” to the ego - they annihilate it.As “ Oneness ” does - “ Oneness ” renders egos obsolete.The ego is a lone wolf, a relentless machine of needing more, more, more. More notoriety, more acclaim, more worship, more stuff, more superiority, more recognition, more POWER. You  and the relationship were only the vehicle to try to get these things. It was never about love and all the synonyms that go with love.There is no genuine relationship possible with a narcissist for this reason - period. There is only, after narcissistic abuse, the ability to heal and create a genuine relationship with yourself  .And this is what our healing is all about. Deep Self-Reflection Revealing the Empowering TruthNaturally, until we really look inwards, and accept that we are the generative source of our own experience - we will not only be very confused about what is going on - we will also blame the narcissist for what is happening to us.And this is something that victims stuck in victimhood have a very hard time accepting (as I once did also) …This … as an adult no-one else other than ourselves is responsible for our wellbeing - we are.We need to understand that the narcissists and codependents are playing out two sides of the same coin.The glue that is holding the narcissist and the codependent together is neediness.Meaning: I need something from you that I can't supply for myself.We know that the narcissist needs narcissistic supply. He or she can't self provide any positive energy, self worth or self approval - it all has to come from the outside.And when we deeply investigate ourselves to heal and break free from the prison, enmeshment and future or present horror of narcissistic takeover - we discover we assigned the narcissist as our source of “ feeling loved ” or “ feeling attractive ” or “ having security ” or “ a fun lifestyle ” or “ not having to be alone anymore ” or “ great sex ” - or whatever it is that we rationalise is worth being in a relationship that we know deep in our heart is not healthy for us.We try to believe it is “ love ” but it's not, really it is an obsession based on fear - the fear that without this person we may not be able to have this “ thing ” or “ state ” in our future - that we are not going to be able to generate it for ourselves.I promise you that is the real reason you  are  staying - and until that development and healing within yourself  is addressed, you  are  highly susceptible to hanging around whilst the intense devaluation continues.Or you  may never be able to heal and move past the trauma that your  devaluation caused - even long after you  have  crawled away barely alive, or have  been thrown in the gutter and discarded mercilessly.So many of us were trapped in the cycle of abuse, and I know that many people in this community still are.This is what the cycle of abuse looks like: abuse … breakdown … reconnect … relief … tension building … abuse … breakdown … reconnect … relief … tension building - and the cycle continuing all over again.In faster times with greater intensity, all for the higher purpose of bringing the lesson screaming home to us, “ This is NOT your soul truth to be living this, and HOW MUCH pain do you need to get it?! ”That's the lesson …What our soul truth is about, IS the coming home to ourselves to be able to heal the gaps that led us to and hooked us into narcissistic abuse. Then we break free, and we don't just survive, we evolve ourselves to a level beyond trauma and beyond abuse.That is what thriving after narcissistic abuse is all about, and I'd love you to learn about that.If this article resonated with you I would love you to join me for my next free Live Teleclass called the 3 Keys To Thriving After Narcissistic Abuse. In this event I share my healing system, Quanta Freedom Healing which has allowed thousands of people from over 50 different countries to break free from narcissistic abuse and start new lives filled with abundance, freedom and joy.Also, if you know someone who is in an abusive relationship, who is playing out these cycles with a narcissist, please pass this article on to them.And please if you have any questions or comments, write them in the section below, I respond to all of them.
