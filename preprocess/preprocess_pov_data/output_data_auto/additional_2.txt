something even more absurd than the " breakneck 90 m/h on a snowy night " ?? My  personal experience . I  have  deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article breakneck 90 m/h on a snowy night . It also reminds me  of something that I  experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people . A couple of years ago , my  neighbor approached me  to borrow my  car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport . He also said both his wife and children wanted to go . As his car was too small and mine  was big , it could make his parents more comfortable . He added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me  before noon . Although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me  , we  lived in the same apartment building after all and were both chinese . So i  discussed with my  wife back home and lent him  the car as we  thought we  would not be using the car until the same afternoon . And then something happened ... At 1:00 pm , the neighbor called me  , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm . I  of course agreed and asked them not to rush . This wait lasted till 5:30 pm , when the neighbor told me  in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures . I  comforted him  first and asked my  friend to rush me  to the hospital . My  neighbor showed me  the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my  neighbor's fault . He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn . My  car was completely damaged and had been towed away . I  forced myself  to refrain from the grief of loosing my  beloved car -lrb- mine  was liability - only coverage -rrb- and asked the friend to send their family home . And then the nightmare began . The next day , my  neighbor called me  , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from . I  told him part would be covered by my  car insurance . After a while , he  called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford . I  tried my  best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly . Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this . She also said my  car was a japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my  car to blame for the car accident . She added that i  should pay the money because the car was mine  . I  hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on . My  wife -lsb- pw% -rsb- had been persuading me  aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury . She asked me  to take no heed of them and let them calm down first . So i  did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry . Out of my  expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my  original idea . The telephone rang just as i  was about to go to work in the morning . I  thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily . Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man . He said in an incontestable tone that my  neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my  car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me  if i  compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -lrb- three times -rrb- , otherwise they would see me  in court . He  added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court . As a great chinese guy , how could I  be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ? I  also took up the weapon of law for justice . Of course , i  also retained a lawyer . Out of my  expectation , my  lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls . One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident . There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them . Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station . The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch . The second call was to their lawyer . So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit . Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me  several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening . The most classic one was : do n't ever dream of living a life back to china , as we have people across the country . Disgusting !
