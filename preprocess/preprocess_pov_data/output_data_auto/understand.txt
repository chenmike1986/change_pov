<document_text>
I  drive  into downtown Boston, and after half an hour Dr. Hooper can see me . I  sit  on a gurney in an examining room, behind a yellow curtain. Jutting out of the wall at waist height is a horizontal flatscreen, adjusted for tunnel vision so it appears blank from my  angle. The doctor types at the keyboard, presumably calling up my  file, and then starts examining me . As he's checking my  pupils with a penlight, I  tell  him about my  nightmares.“ Did you ever have any before the accident, Leon? ” He  gets out his little mallet and taps at my  elbows, knees, and ankles.“ Never. Are these a side effect of the drug? ”“ Not a side effect. The hormone K therapy regenerated a lot of damaged neurons, and that's an enormous change that your brain has to adjust to. The nightmares are probably just a sign of that. ”“ Is this permanent? ”“ It's unlikely, ” he  says. “ Once your brain gets used to having all those pathways again, you'll be fine. Now touch your index finger to the tip of your nose, and then bring it to my finger here. ” I  do  what he  tells me . Next he  has me  tap each finger to my  thumb, quickly. Then I  have  to walk a straight line, as if I  am  taking a sobriety test. After that, he  starts quizzing me .“ Name the parts of an ordinary shoe. ”“ There's the sole, the heel, the laces. Um, the holes that the laces go through are eyes, and then there's the tongue, underneath the laces ... ”“ Okay. Repeat this number: three nine one seven four - ”“ - six two. ” Dr. Hooper wasn't expecting that. “What?”“ Three nine one seven four six two. You used that number the first time you examined me, when I was still an inpatient. I guess it's a number you test patients with a lot. ”“ You weren't supposed to memorize it; it's meant to be a test of immediate recall. ”“ I didn't intentionally memorize it. I just happened to remember it. ”“ Do you remember the number from the second time I examined you? ” I  pause  for a moment. “ Four zero eight one five nine two. ” He  is surprised. “ Most people can't retain so many digits if they've only heard them once. Do you use mnemonic tricks? ” I  shake  my  head. “ No. I always keep phone numbers in the autodialer. ”He goes to the terminal and taps at the numeric keypad. “ Try this one. ” He  reads a fourteen digit number, and I  repeat  it back to him. “ You think you can do it backwards? ” I  recite  the digits in reverse order. He  frowns, and starts typing something into my  file. I  am  sitting in front of a terminal in one of the testing rooms in the psychiatric ward; it's the nearest place Dr. Hooper could get some intelligence tests. There's a small mirror set in one wall, probably with a video camera behind it. In case it's recording, I  smile  at it and wave  briefly. I  always do  that to the hidden cameras in automatic cash machines. Dr. Hooper comes in with a printout of my  test results. “ Well, Leon, you did ... very well. On both tests you scored in the ninety-ninth percentile. ” My  jaw drops. “ You're kidding. ”“ No, I'm not. ” He has trouble believing it himself. “ Now that number doesn't indicate how many questions you got right; it means that relative to the general population - ”“ I know what it means, ” I  say  absently. “ I was in the seventieth percentile when they tested us in high school. ” Ninety ninth percentile.Inwardly, I  am  trying to find some sign of this. What should it feel like? He  sits down on the table, still looking at the printout. “ You never attended college, did you? ” I  return  my  attention to him . “ I did, but I left before graduating. My ideas of education didn't mesh with the professors'. ”“ I see. ” He probably takes this to mean I  flunked out. “ Well, clearly you've improved tremendously. A little of that may have come about naturally as you grew older, but most of it must be a result of the hormone K therapy. ”“ This is one hell of a side effect. ”“ Well, don't get too excited. Test scores don't predict how well you can do things in the real world. ” I  roll  my  eyes upward when Dr. Hooper isn't looking. Something amazing is going on, and all he  can offer is a truism. “ I'd like to follow up on this with some more tests. Can you come in tomorrow? ”* The Neurologist-in-chief, Dr. Shea, has taken over my  case, presumably because he wants to take the credit. I  scarcely know  him, but he acts as if I  have  been his patient for years. He's asked me  into his office to have a talk. He interlaces his fingers and rests his elbows on his desk. “ How do you feel about the increase in your intelligence? ” he asks.What an inane question. “ I'm very pleased about it. ”“ Good, ” says Dr. Shea. “ So far, we've found no adverse effects of the hormone K therapy. You don't require any further treatment for the brain damage from your accident. ” I  nod . “ However, we're conducting a study to learn more about the hormone's effect on intelligence. If you're willing, we'd like to give you a further injection of the hormone, and then monitor the results. ”Suddenly he's got my  attention; finally, something worth listening to. “ I'd be willing to do that. ”“ You understand that this is purely for investigational purposes, not therapeutic. You may benefit from it with further gains in your intelligence, but this is not medically necessary for your health. ”“ I understand. I suppose I have to sign a consent form. ”“ Yes. We can also offer you some compensation for participating in this study. ” He names a figure, but I  am  barely listening.“ That'll be fine. ” I  am  imagining where this might lead, what it might mean for me , and a thrill runs through me .“ We'd also like you to sign a confidentiality agreement. Clearly this drug is enormously exciting, but we don't want any announcements to be made prematurely. ”“ Certainly, Dr. Shea. Has anyone been given additional injections before? ”“ Of course; you're not going to be a guinea pig. I can assure you, there haven't been any harmful side effects. ”“ What sort of effects did they experience? ”“ It's better if we don't plant suggestions in your mind: you might imagine you were experiencing the symptoms I mention. ” Shea's very comfortable with the doctor-knows-best routine. I  keep  pushing. “ Can you at least tell me how much their intelligence increased? ”“ Every individual is different. You shouldn't base your expectations on what's happened to others. ” I  conceal  my  frustration. “ Very well, Doctor. ”* The visiting doctor's name is Clausen, and he doesn't behave like the other doctors. Judging by his manner, he's accustomed to wearing a mask of blandness with his patients, but he's a bit uncomfortable today. He affects an air of friendliness, but it isn't as fluent as the perfunctory noise that the other doctors make.“ The test works this way, Leon: you'll read some descriptions of various situations, each presenting a problem. After each one, I want you to tell me what you'd do to solve that problem. ” I  nod . “ I've had this kind of test before. ”“ Fine, fine. ” Clausen types a command, and the screen in front of me  fills with text. I  read  the scenario: it's a problem in scheduling and prioritizing. It's realistic, which is unusual; scoring such a test is too arbitrary for most researchers' tastes. I  wait  before giving my  answer, though Clausen is still surprised at my  speed.“ That's very good, Leon. ” He hits a key on his computer. “ Try this one. ” We  continue with more scenarios. As I  am  reading the fourth one, Clausen is careful to display only professional detachment. My  response to this problem is of special interest to him, but he doesn't want me  to know. The scenario involves office politics and fierce competition for a promotion. I  realize  who Clausen is: he's a government psychologist, perhaps military, probably part of the CIA's Office of Research and Development. This test is meant to gauge hormone K's potential for producing strategists. That's why he's uncomfortable with me : he's used to dealing with soldiers and government employees, subjects whose job is to follow orders.It's likely that the CIA will wish to retain me  as a subject for more tests; they may do the same with other patients, depending on their performance. After that, they'll get some volunteers from their ranks, starve their brains of oxygen, and treat them with hormone K. I  certainly do  not wish to become a CIA resource, but I  have  already demonstrated enough ability to arouse their interest. The best I  can do is to downplay my  skills and get this question wrong. I  offer  a poor course of action as my  answer, and Clausen is disappointed. Nonetheless, we  press on. I  take  longer on the scenarios now, and give  weaker responses. Sprinkled among the harmless questions are the critical ones: one about avoiding a hostile corporate takeover, another about mobilizing people to prevent the construction of a coal-burning plant. I  miss  each of these questions. Clausen dismisses me  when the test ends; he's already trying to formulate his recommendations. If I  had shown my  true abilities, the CIA would recruit me  immediately. My  uneven performance will reduce their eagerness, but it will not change their minds; the potential returns are too great for them to ignore hormone K. My  situation has changed profoundly; when the CIA decides to retain me  as a test subject, my  consent will be purely optional. I  must make plans.*It's two days later when Shea calls.“ Leon, you have to come in for an examination. I've just been informed: adverse side effects have been found in patients treated with hormone K at another hospital. ” He's lying; he'd never tell me  that over the phone. “ What sort of side effects? ”“ Loss of vision. There's excessive growth of the optic nerve, followed by deterioration. ”The CIA must have ordered this when they heard that I  had withdrawn from the study. Once I  am  back in the hospital, Shea will declare me  mentally incompetent, and confine me  to their care. Then I  will be transferred to a government research institution. I  assume  an expression of alarm. “ I'll come down right away. ”“ Good. ” Shea is relieved that his delivery was convincing. “ We can examine you as soon as you arrive. ” I  hang  up and turn  on my  terminal to check the latest information in the FDA database. There's no mention of any adverse effects, on the optic nerve or anywhere else. I  do  not discount the possibility that such effects might arise in the future, but I  will discover them by myself .It's time to leave Boston. I  begin  packing. I  will empty my  bank accounts when I  go . Selling the equipment in my  studio would generate more cash, but most of it is too large to transport; I  take  only a few of the smallest pieces. After I  have  been working a couple of hours, the phone rings again: Shea wondering where I  am . This time I  let  the machine pick it up.“ Leon, are you there? This is Dr. Shea. We've been expecting you for quite some time. ”He'll try calling one more time, and then he'll send the orderlies in white suits, or perhaps the actual police, to pick me  up.*The taxi stops; I  pay  the driver and walk  up to the apartment building. The electric lock on the door opens for me . I  take  off my  coat and climb  four flights.The door to Reynolds' apartment is also open. I  walk  down the entryway to the living room, hearing a hyperaccelerated polyphony from a digital synthesizer. Evidently it's his  own work; the sounds are modulated in ways undetectable to normal hearing, and even I  can not discern any pattern to them. An experiment in high information density music, perhaps.There is a large swivel chair in the room, its back turned toward me . Reynolds is not visible, and he is restricting his somatic emanations to comatose levels. I  imply  my  presence and my  recognition of his  identity.“ Reynolds. ”Acknowledgment. “ Greco. ”The chair turns around smoothly, slowly. He  smiles at me  and shuts off the synthesizer at his side. Gratification. “ A pleasure to meet you. ”To communicate, we  are exchanging fragments from the somatic language of the normals: a shorthand version of the vernacular. Each phrase takes a tenth of a second. I  give  a suggestion of regret. “ A shame it must be as enemies. ”Wistful agreement, then supposition. “ Indeed. Imagine how we could change the world, acting in concert. Two enhanced minds; such an opportunity missed. ”True, acting cooperatively would produce achievements far outstripping any we  might attain individually. Any interaction would be incredibly fruitful: how satisfying it would be simply to have a discussion with someone who can match my  speed, who can offer an idea that is new to me , who can hear the same melodies I  do . He  desires the same. It pains us  both to think that one of us  will not leave this room alive.An offer. “ Do you wish to share what we've learned in the past six months? ” He knows what my  answer is. We  will speak aloud, since somatic language has no technical vocabulary. Reynolds says, quickly and quietly, five words. They are more pregnant with meaning than any stanza of poetry: each word provides a logical toehold I  can mount after extracting everything implicit in the preceding ones. Together they encapsulate a revolutionary insight into sociology; using somatic language he  indicates that it was among the first he ever achieved. I  came to a similar realization, but formulated it differently. I  immediately counter  with seven words, four that summarize the distinctions between my  insight and his , and three that describe a nonobvious result of the distinctions. He  responds. We  continue. We  are like two bards, each cueing the other to extemporize another stanza, jointly composing an epic poem of knowledge. Within moments we  accelerate, talking over each other's words but hearing every nuance, until we  are absorbing, concluding, and responding, continuously, simultaneously, synergistically.Many minutes pass. I  learn  much from him , and he  from me . It's exhilarating, to be suddenly awash in ideas whose implications would take me  days to consider fully. But we 're also gathering strategic information: I  infer  the extent of his  unspoken knowledge, compare  it with my  own, and simulate  his corresponding inferences. For there is always the awareness that this must come to an end; the formulation of our  exchanges renders ideological differences luminously clear. Reynolds hasn't witnessed the beauty that I  have ; he's stood before lovely insights, oblivious to them. The sole gestalt that inspires him is the one I  ignored: that of the planetary society, of the biosphere. I  am  a lover of beauty, he  of humanity. Each feels that the other has ignored great opportunities. He  has an unmentioned plan for establishing a global network of influence, to create world prosperity. To execute it, he'll employ a number of people, some of whom he'll give simple heightened intelligence, some meta-self-awareness; a few of them will pose threats to him. “ Why assume such a risk for the sake of the normals? ”“ Your indifference toward the normals would be justified if you were enlightened; your realm wouldn't intersect theirs. But as long as you and I can still comprehend their affairs, we can't ignore them. ” I  can measure the distance between our  respective moral stances precisely, see  the stress between their incompatible radiating lines. What motivates him  is not simply compassion or altruism, but something that entails both those things. On the other hand, I  concentrate  only on understanding the sublime. “ What about the beauty visible from enlightenment? Doesn't it attract you? ”“ You know what kind of structure would be required to hold an enlightened consciousness. I have no reason to wait the time it would take to establish the necessary industries. ” He considers intelligence to be a means, while I  view  it as an end in itself. Greater intelligence would be of little use to him . At his present level, he can find the best possible solution to any problem within the realm of human experience, and many beyond. All he'd require is sufficient time to implement his solution.There's no point in further discussion. By mutual assent, we  begin.It's meaningless to speak of an element of surprise when we  time our  attacks; our  awareness can't become more acute with forewarning. It's not affording a courtesy to each other when we  agree to begin our  battle, it's actualizing the inevitable.In the models of each other that we 've constructed from our  inferences, there are gaps, lacunae: the internal psychological developments and discoveries that each has made. No echoes have radiated from those spaces, no strands have tied them to the world web, until now. I  begin . I  concentrate  on initiating two reinforcing loops in him . One is very simple: it increases blood pressure rapidly and enormously. If it were to continue unchecked for over a second, this loop would raise his blood pressure to stroke levels - perhaps 400 over 300 - and burst capillaries in his brain. Reynolds detects it immediately. Though it's clear from our  conversation that he never investigated the inducement of biofeedback loops in others, he recognizes what is happening. Once he does, he reduces his heart rate and dilates the blood vessels throughout his body.But it is the other, subtler reinforcing loop that is my  real attack. This is a weapon I  have  been developing ever since my  search for Reynolds began. This loop causes his  to dramatically overproduce neurotransmitter antagonists, preventing impulses from crossing his synapses, shutting down brain activity. I  have  been radiating this loop at a much higher intensity than the other.As Reynolds is parrying the ostensible attack, he experiences a slight weakening of his concentration, masked by the effects of the heightened blood pressure. A second later, his body begins to amplify the effect on its own. Reynolds is shocked to feel his thoughts blurring. He searches for the precise mechanism: he'll identify it soon, but he will not be able to scrutinize it for long.Once his brain function has been reduced to the level of a normal, I  should be able to manipulate his mind easily. Hypnotic techniques can make him regurgitate most of the information his enhanced mind possesses. I  inspect  his  somatic expressions, watching them betray his diminishing intelligence. The regression is unmistakable.And then it stops. Reynolds is in equilibrium. I  am  stunned. He  was able to break the reinforcing loop. He has stopped the most sophisticated offensive I  could mount.Next, he reverses the damage already done. Even starting with reduced capabilities, he can correct the balance of neurotransmitters. Within seconds, Reynolds is fully restored. I  too was transparent to him. During our  conversation he deduced that I  had investigated reinforcing loops, and as we  communicated, he derived a general preventative without my  detecting it. Then he observed the specifics of my  particular attack while it was working, and learned how to reverse its effects. I  am  astonished at his discernment, his speed, his stealth. He  acknowledges my  skill. “ A very interesting technique; appropriate, given your self-absorption. I saw no indication when ” Abruptly he projects a different somatic signature, one that I  recognize . He  used it when he walked behind me  at a grocery store, three days ago. The aisle was crowded; around me  were an old woman, wheezing behind her air filter, and a thin teenager on an acid trip, wearing a liquid crystal shirt of shifting psychedelic patterns. Reynolds slipped behind me , his mind on the porn mag stands. His  surveillance didn't inform him of my  reinforcing loops, but it did permit a more detailed picture of my  mind.A possibility I  anticipated. I  reformulate  my  psyche, incorporating random elements for unpredictability. The equations of my  mind now bear little resemblance to those of my  normal consciousness, undermining any assumptions Reynolds may have made, and rendering ineffectual any psyche-specific weapons of his. I  project  the equivalent of a smile. Reynolds smiles back. “ Have you ever considered - ” Suddenly he projects only silence. He is about to speak, but I  can not predict what. Then it comes, as a whisper: “ self destruct commands, Greco? ”As he says it, a lacuna in my  reconstruction of him  fills and overflows, the implications coloring all that I  know  about him. He means the Word: the sentence that, when uttered, would destroy the mind of the listener. Reynolds is claiming that the myth is true, that every mind has such a trigger built in; that for every person, there is a sentence that can reduce him to an idiot, a lunatic, a catatonic. And he is claiming he knows the one for me . I  immediately tune  out all sensory input, directing it to an insulated buffer of short-term memory. Then I  conceive  a simulator of my  own consciousness to receive the input and absorb it at reduced speed. As a metaprogrammer I  will monitor the equations of the simulation indirectly. Only after the sensory information has been confirmed as safe will I  actually receive it. If the simulator is destroyed, my  consciousness should be isolated, and I  will retrace the individual steps leading to the crash and derive guidelines for reprogramming my  psyche. I  get  everything in place by the time Reynolds has finished saying my  name; his  next sentence could be the destruct command. I  am  now receiving my  sensory input with a one hundred and twenty millisecond time lag. I  reexamine  my  analysis of the human mind, explicitly searching for evidence to verify his  assertion.Meanwhile I  give  my  response lightly, casually. “ Hit me with your best shot. ”“ Don't worry; it's not on the tip of my tongue. ” My  search produces something. I  curse  myself : there's a very subtle back door to a psyche's design, which I  lacked the necessary mind set to notice. Whereas my  weapon was one born of introspection, his  is something only a manipulator could originate. Reynolds knows that I  have  built my  defenses; is his trigger command designed to circumvent them? I  continue  deriving the nature of the trigger command's actions.“ What are you waiting for? ” He  is confident that additional time will not allow me  to construct a defense.“ Try to guess. ” So smug. Can he actually toy with me  so easily? I  arrive  at a theoretical description of a trigger's effects on normals. A single command can reduce any subcritical mind to a tabula rasa, but an undetermined degree of customization is needed for enhanced minds. The erasure has distinctive symptoms, which my  simulator can alert me  to, but those are symptoms of a process calculable by me . By definition the destruct command is that specific equation beyond my  ability to imagine; would my  metaprogrammer collapse while diagnosing the simulator's condition?“ Have you used the destruct command on normals? ” I  begin  calculating what's needed to generate a customized destruct command. “ Once, as an experiment on a drug dealer. Afterward I concealed the evidence with a blow to the temple. ”It becomes obvious that the generation is a colossal task. Generating a trigger requires intimate knowledge of my  mind; I  extrapolate  what he  could have learned about me . It appears to be insufficient, given my  reprogramming, but he  may have techniques of observation unknown to me . I  am  acutely aware of the advantage he  has gained by studying the outside world.“ You will have to do this many times. ” His  regret is evident. His plan can't be implemented without more deaths: those of normal humans, by strategic necessity, and those of a few enhanced assistants of his, whose temptation by greater heights would interfere. After using the command, Reynolds may reprogram them - or me  - as savants, having focused intentions and restricted self metaprogrammers. Such deaths are a necessary cost of his plan.“ I make no claims of being a saint. ”Merely a savior.Normals might think him  a tyrant, because they mistake him for one of them, and they've never trusted their own judgment. They can't fathom that Reynolds is equal to the task. His judgment is optimal in questions of their affairs, and their notions of greed and ambition do not apply to an enhanced mind.In a histrionic gesture, Reynolds raises his hand, forefinger extended, as if to make a point. I  do  not have sufficient information to generate his destruct command, so for the moment I  can only attend to defense. If I  can survive his  attack, I  may have time to launch another one of my  own.With his finger upraised, he  says, “ Understand. ”At first I  do  not. And then, horrifyingly, I  do . He  didn't design the command to be spoken; it's not a sensory trigger at all. It's a memory trigger: the command is made out of a string of perceptions, individually harmless, that he planted in my  brain like time bombs. The mental structures that were formed as a result of those memories are now resolving into a pattern, forming a gestalt that defines my  dissolution. I  am  intuiting the Word myself .Immediately my  mind is working faster than ever before. Against my  will, a lethal realization is suggesting itself to me . I  am  trying to halt the associations, but these memories can't be suppressed. The process occurs inexorably, as a consequence of my  awareness, and like a man falling from a height, I  am  forced to watch.Milliseconds pass. My  death passes before my  eyes.An image of the grocery store when Reynolds passed by. The psychedelic shirt the boy was wearing; Reynolds had programmed the display to implant a suggestion within me , ensuring that my  “ randomly ” reprogrammed psyche remained receptive. Even then.No time. All I  can do is metaprogram myself  over randomly, at a furious pace. An act of desperation, possibly crippling.The strange modulated sounds that I  heard when I  first entered Reynolds' apartment. I  absorbed the fatal insights before I  had any defenses raised. I  tear  apart my  psyche, but still the conclusion grows clearer, the resolution sharper. Myself , constructing the simulator. Designing those defense structures gave me  the perspective needed to recognize the gestalt. I  concede  his  greater ingenuity. It bodes well for his endeavor. Pragmatism avails a savior far more than aestheticism. I  wonder  what he  intends to do after he's saved the world. I  comprehend  the Word, and the means by which it operates, and so I  dissolve .
