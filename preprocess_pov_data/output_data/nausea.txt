The two boys stay near the stove. The younger one has brown hair, a skin almost too fine and atiny mouth, wicked and proud. His friend, a big heavy-set boy with the shadow of a moustache,touched his elbow and murmured a few words. The little brown haired boy did not answer, but he gave an imperceptible smile, full of arrogance and self-sufficiency. Then both of them nonchalantlychose a dictionary from one of the shelves and went over to The Self Taught Man who was staring wearily at them. They seemed to ignore his existence, but they sat down right next to him, the brown haired boy on his left and the thickset one on the left of the brown haired boy. They began lookingthrough the dictionary. The Self Taught Man's look wandered over the room, then returned to his reading. Never had a library offered such a reassuring spectacle: I  heard no sound, except the short breathing of the fat woman, I  only saw heads bent over books. Yet, at that moment, I  had the feeling that something unpleasant was going to happen. All these people who lowered their eyes with such a studious look seemed to be playing a comedy: a few instants before I  felt something like a breath of cruelty pass over us . I  had finished reading but had not decided to leave: I  was waiting, pretending to read my newspaper. What increased my  curiosity and annoyance was that the others were waiting too. Itseemed as though my  neighbour was turning the pages of her book more rapidly. A few minutespassed, then I  heard whispering. I  cautiously raised my  head. Both boys had closed their dictionaries. The brown haired one was not talking, his face, stamped with deference and interest, was turned to the right. Half hidden behind his shoulder, the blond was listening and laughing silently. Who's talking? I  thought.It was the Self Taught Man. He was bent over his young neighbour, eye to eye, smiling at him; I saw his lips move and, from time to time, his long eyelashes palpitate. I  did not recognize this look of youthfulness; he  was almost charming. But, from time to time, he interrupted himself and looked anxiously behind him. The boy seemed to drink his words. There was nothing extraordinary about this little scene and I  was going to go back to my  reading when I  saw the boy slowly slide his hand behind his back on the edge of the table. Thus hidden from the Self Taught Man's eyes it went on its way for a moment, and began to feel around, then, finding the arm of the bigger boy, pinched it violently. The other, too absorbed in silent enjoyment of the Self Taught Man's words, had not seen it coming. He jumped up and his mouth opened widely in surprise and admiration. The brown haired boy had kept his look of respectful interest. One might have doubted that this mischievous hand belonged to him. What are they going to do to him? I  thought. I  knew that something bad was going to happen, and I  saw too that there was still time to keep it from happening. But I  could not guess what there was to prevent. For a second, I  had the idea of getting up, slapping the Self Taught Man on the shoulder and starting a conversation with him. But just at that moment he  caught my  look. He stopped speaking and pinched his lips together with an air of irritation. Discouraged, I  quickly lowered my  eyes and made a show of reading my  paper. However, the fat woman had set down her book and raised her head. She seemed hypnotized. I  felt sure the woman was going to burst: they all wanted something to burst. What could I  do? I  glanced at the Corsican: he wasn't looking out of the window any more, he had turned half way towards us .Fifteen minutes passed. The Self Taught Man had begun his whispering again. I  did not dare lookat him any more, but I  could well imagine his young and tender air and those heavy looks whichweighed on him without his knowing it. Once I  heard his laugh, a fluted, childish little laugh. Itgripped my  heart: it seemed as though the two kids were going to drown a cat. Then the whispersstopped suddenly. This silence seemed tragic to me : it was the end, the deathblow. I  bowed my  head over my  newspaper and pretended to read; but I  was not reading: I  raised my  eyes as high as I  could, trying to catch what was happening in this silence across from me . By turning my  head slightly, I  could see something out of the corner of my  eye: it was a hand, the small white hand which slid along the table a little while ago. Now it was resting on its back, relaxed, soft and sensual, it had the indolent nudity of a woman sunning herself after bathing. A brown hairy object approached it, hesitant. It was a thick finger, yellowed by tobacco; inside this hand it had all the grossness of a male sex organ. It stopped for an instant, rigid, pointing at the fragile palm, then suddenly, it timidly began to stroke it. I  was not surprised, I  was only furious at the Self Taught Man; couldn't he hold himself back, the fool, didn't he realize the risk he was running? He still had a chance, a small chance: if he were to put both hands on the table, on either side of the book, if he stayed absolutely still, perhaps he might be able to escape his destiny this time. But I  knew he  was going to miss his chance: the finger passed slowly, humbly, over the inert flesh, barely grazing it, without daring to put any weight on it: you might have thought it was conscious of its ugliness. I  raised my  head brusquely, I  could not stand this obstinate little back-and-forth movement any more: I  tried to catch the Self Taught Man's eye and I  coughed loudly to warn him. But he  closed his eyes, he was smiling. His other hand had disappeared under the table. The boys were not laughing any more, they had both turned pale. The brown haired one pinched his lips, he was afraid, he looked as though what was happening had gone beyond his control. But he did not draw his hand away, he left it on the table, motionless, a little curled. His friend's mouth was open in a stupid, horrified look.Then the Corsican began to shout. He had come up without anyone hearing him and placed himself behind the Self Taught Man's chair. He was crimson and looked as though he were going tolaugh, but his eyes were flashing. I  started up from my  chair, but I  felt almost relieved: the waiting was too unbearable. I  wanted it to be over as soon as possible. I  wanted them to throw him out if they wanted, but get it over with. The two boys, white as sheets, seized their satchels and disappeared.
