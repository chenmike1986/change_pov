<document_text>
It's not my  fault. So you can't blame me . I  did not do it and have  no idea how it happened. It didn't take more than an hour after they pulled her  out from between my  legs for me  to realize something was wrong. Really wrong. She was so black she scared me . Midnight black, Sudanese black. I  am  light skinned, with good hair, what we  call high yellow, and so is Lula Ann's father. Ain't nobody in my  family anywhere near that color. Tar is the closest I  can think of, yet her  hair don't go with the skin. It's different - straight but curly, like the hair on those naked tribes in Australia. You might think she's a throwback, but a throwback to what? You should've seen my  grandmother; she passed for white, married a white man, and never said another word to any one of her children. Any letter she got from my  mother or my  aunts she sent right back, unopened. Finally they got the message of no message and let her be. Almost all mulatto types and quadroons did that back in the day - if they had the right kind of hair, that is. Can you imagine how many white folks have Negro blood hiding in their veins? Guess. Twenty per cent, I  heard. My  own mother, Lula Mae, could have passed easy, but she chose not to. She told me  the price she paid for that decision. When she and my  father went to the courthouse to get married, there were two Bibles, and they had to put their hands on the one reserved for Negroes. The other one was for white people's hands. The Bible! Can you beat it? My  mother was a housekeeper for a rich white couple. They ate every meal she cooked and insisted she scrub their backs while they sat in the tub, and God knows what other intimate things they made her do, but no touching of the same Bible.Some of you probably think it's a bad thing to group ourselves according to skin color - the lighter the better - in social clubs, neighborhoods, churches, sororities, even colored schools. But how else can we  hold on to a little dignity? How else can we  avoid being spit on in a drugstore, elbowed at the bus stop, having to walk in the gutter to let whites have the whole sidewalk, being charged a nickel at the grocer's for a paper bag that's free to white shoppers? Let alone all the name calling. I  heard about all of that and much, much more. But because of my  mother's skin color she  wasn't stopped from trying on hats or using the ladies' room in the department stores. And my  father could try on shoes in the front part of the shoe store, not in a back room. Neither one of them would let themselves drink from a “ Colored Only ” fountain, even if they were dying of thirst. I  hate  to say it, but from the very beginning in the maternity ward the baby, Lula Ann, embarrassed me . Her birth skin was pale like all babies', even African ones, but it changed fast. I  thought I  was going crazy when she  turned blue-black right before my  eyes. I  know  I  went crazy for a minute, because - just for a few seconds - I  held a blanket over her  face and pressed. But I  could not do that, no matter how much I  wished she  hadn't been born with that terrible color. I  even thought of giving her away to an orphanage someplace. But I  was scared to be one of those mothers who leave their babies on church steps. Recently, I  heard about a couple in Germany, white as snow, who had a dark-skinned baby nobody could explain. Twins, I  believe  - one white, one colored. But I  do  not know if it's true. All I  know  is that, for me , nursing her  was like having a pickaninny sucking my  teat. I  went to bottle-feeding soon as I  got home. My  husband, Louis, is a porter, and when he got back off the rails he looked at me  like I  really was crazy and looked at the baby like she was from the planet Jupiter. He wasn't a cussing man, so when he said, “ God damn! What the hell is this? ” I  knew we  were in trouble. That was what did it - what caused the fights between me  and him. It broke our  marriage to pieces. We  had three good years together, but when she was born he blamed me  and treated Lula Ann like she was a stranger - more than that, an enemy. He never touched her. I  never did convince him that I  did never, ever fooled around with another man. He was dead sure I  was lying. We  argued and argued till I  told him her the baby's blackness had to be from his own family - not mine . That was when it got worse, so bad he just up and left and I  had to look for another, cheaper place to live. I  did the best I  could. I  knew enough not to take her  with me  when I  applied to landlords, so I  left her with a teenage cousin to babysit. I  did not take her outside much, anyway, because, when I  pushed her in the baby carriage, people would lean down and peek in to say something nice and then give a start or jump back before frowning. That hurt. I  could have been the babysitter if our  skin colors were reversed. It was hard enough just being a colored woman - even a high-yellow one - trying to rent in a decent part of the city. Back in the nineties, when Lula Ann was born, the law was against discriminating in who you could rent to, but not many landlords paid attention to it. They made up reasons to keep you out. But I  got lucky with Mr. Leigh, though I  know  he upped the rent seven dollars from what he'd advertised, and he had a fit if you were a minute late with the money. I  told her  to call me  “ Sweetness ” instead of “ Mother ” or “ Mama. ” It was safer. Her being that black and having what I  think  are too thick lips and calling me  “ Mama ” would've confused people. Besides, she has funny colored eyes, crow black with a blue tint - something witchy about them, too.So it was just us  two for a long while, and I  do  not have to tell you how hard it is being an abandoned wife. I  guess  Louis felt a little bit bad after leaving us  like that, because a few months later on he found out where I  had moved to and started sending me  money once a month, though I  never asked him to and did not go to court to get it. His fifty dollar money orders and my  night job at the hospital got me  and Lula Ann off welfare. Which was a good thing. I  wish  they would stop calling it welfare and go back to the word they used when my  mother was a girl. Then it was called “ relief. ” Sounds much better, like it's just a short-term breather while you get yourself together. Besides, those welfare clerks are mean as spit. When finally I  got work and did not need them anymore, I  was making more money than they ever did. I  guess  meanness filled out their skimpy paychecks, which was why they treated us  like beggars. Especially when they looked at Lula Ann and then back at me  - like I  was trying to cheat or something. Things got better but I  still had to be careful. Very careful in how I  raised her. I  had to be strict, very strict. Lula Ann needed to learn how to behave, how to keep her head down and not to make trouble. I  do  not care how many times she  changes her name. Her color is a cross she will always carry. But it's not my  fault. It's not my  fault. It's not.Oh, yeah, I  feel  bad sometimes about how I  treated Lula Ann when she was little. But you have to understand: I  had to protect her. She didn't know the world. With that skin, there was no point in being tough or sassy, even when you were right. Not in a world where you could be sent to a juvenile lockup for talking back or fighting in school, a world where you'd be the last one hired and the first one fired. She didn't know any of that or how her black skin would scare white people or make them laugh and try to trick her. I  once saw a girl nowhere near as dark as Lula Ann who couldn't have been more than ten years old tripped by one of a group of white boys and when she tried to scramble up another one put his foot on her behind and knocked her flat again. Those boys held their stomachs and bent over with laughter. Long after she got away, they were still giggling, so proud of themselves. If I  had not been watching through the bus window I  would have helped her, pulled her away from that white trash. See, if I  had not trained Lula Ann properly she wouldn't have known to always cross the street and avoid white boys. But the lessons I  taught her paid off, and in the end she made me  proud as a peacock. I  was not a bad mother, you have to know that, but I  may have done some hurtful things to my  only child because I  had to protect her. Had to. All because of skin privileges. At first I  could not see past all that black to know who she was and just plain love her. But I  do . I  really do . I  think  she  understands now. I  think  so.Last two times I  saw her  she was, well, striking. Kind of bold and confident. Each time she came to see me , I  forgot just how black she really was because she was using it to her advantage in beautiful white clothes.Taught me  a lesson I  should have known all along. What you do to children matters. And they might never forget. As soon as she could, she left me  all alone in that awful apartment. She got as far away from me  as she could: dolled herself up and got a big-time job in California. She don't call or visit anymore. She sends me  money and stuff every now and then, but I  have  not seen her in I  do  not know how long. I  prefer  this place - Winston House - to those big, expensive nursing homes outside the city. Mine  is small, homey, cheaper, with twenty four hour nurses and a doctor who comes twice a week. I  am  only sixty three - too young for pasture - but I  came down with some creeping bone disease, so good care is vital. The boredom is worse than the weakness or the pain, but the nurses are lovely. One just kissed me  on the cheek when I  told her I  was going to be a grandmother. Her smile and her compliments were fit for someone about to be crowned. I  showed her the note on blue paper that I  got from Lula Ann—well, she signed it “ Bride, ” but I  never pay  that any attention. Her words sounded giddy. “ Guess what, S. I am so, so happy to pass along this news. I am going to have a baby. I'm too, too thrilled and hope you are, too. ” I  reckon  the thrill is about the baby, not its father, because she doesn't mention him at all. I  wonder  if he is as black as she is. If so, she needn't worry like I  did. Things have changed a mite from when I  was young. Blue blacks are all over TV, in fashion magazines, commercials, even starring in movies.There is no return address on the envelope. So I  guess  I  am  still the bad parent being punished forever till the day I  die  for the well-intended and, in fact, necessary way I  brought her up. I  know  she  hates me . Our  relationship is down to her sending me  money. I  have  to say I  am  grateful for the cash, because I  do  not have to beg for extras, like some of the other patients. If I  want  my  own fresh deck of cards for solitaire, I  can get it and not need to play with the dirty, worn one in the lounge. And I  can buy my  special face cream. But I  am  not fooled. I  know  the money she  sends is a way to stay away and quiet down the little bit of conscience she's got left.If I  sound  irritable, ungrateful, part of it is because underneath is regret. All the little things I  did not do or did wrong. I  remember  when she  had her first period and how I  reacted. Or the times I  shouted when she  stumbled or dropped something. True. I  was really upset, even repelled by her black skin when she was born and at first I  thought of ... No. I  have  to push those memories away - fast. No point. I  know  I  did the best for her under the circumstances. When my  husband ran out on us , Lula Ann was a burden. A heavy one, but I  bore it well.Yes, I  was tough on her. You bet I  was. By the time she turned twelve going on thirteen, I  had to be even tougher. She  was talking back, refusing to eat what I  cooked, primping her hair. When I  braided it, she'd go to school and unbraid it. I  could not let her go bad. I  slammed the lid and warned her about the names she'd be called. Still, some of my  schooling must have rubbed off. See how she turned out? A rich career girl. Can you beat it?Now she's pregnant. Good move, Lula Ann. If you think mothering is all cooing, booties, and diapers you're in for a big shock. Big. You and your nameless boyfriend, husband, pickup – whoever - imagine, Oooh! A baby! Kitchee kitchee koo!Listen to me. You are about to find out what it takes, how the world is, how it works, and how it changes when you are a parent.Good luck, and God help the child.

<raw_sequence>: the first one fired . she did n't know any of that or how her black skin would scare white people or make them laugh and try to trick her . i once saw a girl nowhere near as dark as lula ann who could n't have been more than ten years old tripped by one of a group of white boys and when she tried to scramble up another one put his foot on her behind and knocked her flat again . those boys held their stomachs and bent over with laughter . long after she got away , they were still giggling , so proud of themselves . if i had not been watching through the bus window i would have helped her , pulled her away from that white trash . see , if i had not trained lula ann properly she would n't have known to always cross the street and avoid white boys . but the lessons i taught her paid off , and in the end she made me proud as a peacock . i was not a bad mother , you have to know that , but i may have done some hurtful things

<sentence_num>: 107	<sentence_text>: i once saw a girl nowhere near as dark as lula ann who could n't have been more than ten years old tripped by one of a group of white boys and when she tried to scramble up another one put his foot on her behind and knocked her flat again .
<sentence_num>: 108	<sentence_text>: those boys held their stomachs and bent over with laughter .
<sentence_num>: 109	<sentence_text>: long after she got away , they were still giggling , so proud of themselves .

<sentence_num>: 112	<sentence_text>: but the lessons i taught her paid off , and in the end she made me proud as a peacock .
