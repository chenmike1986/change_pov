The usage of each component is described in the corresponding folder.

The order to use each component is as follows: preprocess, mention selection.

The annotated pov data is in the folder "pov_data".

The results in Table 5 of the paper "Changing the Narrative Perspective: From Deictic to Anaphoric Point of View" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04176) are updated by fixing a bug in the way the dropout was used and the updated results are only slightly different from the ones reported in the paper.
